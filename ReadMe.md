In this project we will try to move the functions and the code from Purple Tabby to a chrome extension.

# TO RUN THE CODE
You would need clone the repository into your desktop.

Next you would need to go to this link [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).
In that page you press the Load unpacked at the top left of the site.
Find and select the cloned repository.

*Note once you have added the extension you might want to reload the page to ensure that the scripts are injected into the webpage correctly.
